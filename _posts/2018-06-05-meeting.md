#### The Topic

[Conda](https://conda.io) is a fantastic resource for Python developers. It has made code management with geospatial and scientific libraries across multiple operating systems much less of a headache for me.

This talk will go over some tips about getting setup with Conda as well as some "Did you know?" type topics including:

- Conda can help make cross-platform development environment management simpler?
  - I can easily have GDAL 1.11 and GDAL 2.2 installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS all with separate environments for Python 2.7 and 3.6?
  - I can specify in the environment file the Python version I used, install system binaries, and pip install packages for the environment?
- Wait, I can still use pip to install in the Python environments too?
- You mean I don't have to have sudo privileges to install binaries without having to compile the code myself (GDAL, netCDF4, etc ...)?
- Using the conda-forge channel is great for scientific and geospatial packages?
- I can insert in environment specific setup scripts on activation?
