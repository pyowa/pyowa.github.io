In the last 5 years sequencing technology has moved from sequencing roughly 10,000 data points/day/machine to over 1 billion data points/day/machine! This mass explosion of data has created a large demand for bioinformaticians and for bioinformatic applications to interpret the data and turn it into actionable information. From this data will flow the technology of tomorrow: personalized and preventative medicine, gene therapy, and genetic modifications capable of providing food to feed the world.

### About Shane
Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics from Brigham Young University, currently enrolled in a Master program at Iowa State in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I have worked in the bioinformatic space now for 5 years, 2 years studying the underlying genetic causes of Alzheimer's Disease at BYU, 1 year with ARUP Laboratories genotyping bloodborne pathogens, and two years at DuPont Pioneer identifying polymorphisms in crops that increase yield (current).

The IMT Group will happily provide Pizza and Soda.
