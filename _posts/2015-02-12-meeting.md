topic: "mrjob - map reduce with python workshop"
speaker: Spencer Herzberg

Ever want to run map reduce jobs in plain old python? [mrjob](https://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/) makes this possible. You can easily code and test map reduce jobs in python on your machine and when you are ready to run on "big data", small changes to your project setup will allow you to run the jobs on Elastic MapReduce or your own Hadoop cluster.

The format will be workshop style so be sure to bring a laptop with python 2.7 and pip installed. We will cover how to create simple map reduce jobs and run them against different datasets.

IMT will happily provide Pizza and Soda.

Hope to see you there!
