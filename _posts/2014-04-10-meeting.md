This month we are going to be doing a workshop. Everybody bring a laptop or come with a friend who has a laptop or be prepared to pair up with someone who has a laptop. Please be sure to get the latest version of Python 3 installed prior to our meeting. If you are not able to, or need help, someone at the group will be more than happy to assist you.

We are going to be doing the Python Koans for Python 3. If you want to check them out in advance, [take a look here][koans].

We will be meeting at the IMT Group at 6pm. Pizza will be provided.

Hope to see you there!
