#### The Topic

The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batteries_Included) page for "Batteries Included" says:

Batteries Included may refer to:

- Batteries Included (company), a computer hardware and software company
- "Batteries Included" (song), a 1996 single by Servotron
- __Motto of the Python programming language, meaning it comes with a large library of useful modules.__
- Batteries Included (slang), in a product usability (mostly in software) it states that the product comes together with all possible parts required for full usability.

I really love working with Python, in part due to its extensive standard library.  We'll go over some of the cool things in there looking at code and examples of their use.


This will probably be my last Pyowa as I am moving.  Thank you to all those who put in the effort to make this happen.
Big thank you to everyone who is part of the community that we are trying to build.  You have inspired me to be better
and shown me all sorts of cool stuff.

Pyowa people, you rock.
