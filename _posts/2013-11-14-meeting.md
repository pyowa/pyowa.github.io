This month Jarrod Taylor will be speaking about "Writing and testing Vim plugins with Python".


Programmers spend a lot of time navigating, editing, and looking at code. Many of us share a desire to work in
the most efficient and satisfying editing environment possible, more often than not this involves customization.
The Vim ecosystem is very mature and boasts a plugin for almost anything, but what do you do when you can't find
a plugin to provide the functionality your work flow demands? I recently found myself in just such a situation.
Luckily, for me I didn't have to learn but a few lines of Vimscript and was able to leverage my existing Python
knowledge to write and test a plugin that provided a solution for my problem. I will take you through the process
of writing and testing a Vim plugin written almost entirely in Python.

Jarrod Taylor is a programmer with an interest in all things open source. He has spent the last seven years
working in Des Moines at a variety of locations including Wells Fargo, Wellmark, and Aviva. Recently Jarrod has
settled in as a senior programmer analyst with a small but talented bunch of developers at The IMT Group.
