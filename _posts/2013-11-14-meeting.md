This month Jarrod Taylor will be speaking about "Writing and testing Vim plugins with Python". We will be meeting
in Ames this month at the new WebFilings office. We will be in a different building that we have been in past
meetings.

Programmers spend a lot of time navigating, editing, and looking at code. Many of us share a desire to work in
the most efficient and satisfying editing environment possible, more often than not this involves customization.
The Vim ecosystem is very mature and boasts a plugin for almost anything, but what do you do when you can't find
a plugin to provide the functionality your work flow demands? I recently found myself in just such a situation.
Luckily, for me I didn't have to learn but a few lines of Vimscript and was able to leverage my existing Python
knowledge to write and test a plugin that provided a solution for my problem. I will take you through the process
of writing and testing a Vim plugin written almost entirely in Python.

Jarrod Taylor is a programmer with an interest in all things open source. He has spent the last seven years
working in Des Moines at a variety of locations including Wells Fargo, Wellmark, and Aviva. Recently Jarrod has
settled in as a senior programmer analyst with a small but talented bunch of developers at The IMT Group.
