### Our Presenter

Tom is a data scientist and software developer for Anaconda Inc.

#### The Topic

Scikit-Learn is the go-to library for machine learning in Python. We'll do
hands-on introductory tutorial for scikit-learn. Attendees should clone the materials from [https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2017-sklearn](https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2017-sklearn)

```
git clone https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2017-sklearn
```

And setup an environment with the required materials. I would recommend installing `miniconda` and running `conda env create` from within the repo. Fetch the data with

```
python fetch_data.py
```

And check your environment with

```
jupyter notebook check_env.ipynb
```

### Our Location

The Forge is located at 1420 Locust above Magnolia Wine Kitchen, and across from the Sculpture Park. Enter through the door on the parking lot side of the building, next to Magnolia Wine Kitchen's outdoor patio. Once inside head up the stairs. Street parking on Locust is free after 6pm.
