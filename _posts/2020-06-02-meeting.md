### Our Topic: Pathlib
Python's `os.path` module has a lot of great functionality to work with file system paths. But have you ever looked at a line of code like this `os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))`  and hoped for a better way?
Have you ever had code break when trying to manipulate paths on Windows or Unix?
Do you not use `os.path` and just add strings together?
Well, there’s good news! In Python 3.4, a new module appeared in the standard library, `pathlib`. It makes working with paths much easier, more expressive, and dare I say more fun?
Join us in June when python programmer, Chris May, joins us from the East Coast, to give us an exploration of the `pathlib` module, and why we would want to use it.

#### Presenter Bio
Over 10 years ago, Chris May started learning python and has been amazed at what one can do with it. Now, he’s empowering others to do more with their time through python training at work, Richmond, Virginia’s PyRVA group, and his website at [everydaysuperpowers.dev](http://everydaysuperpowers.dev).
