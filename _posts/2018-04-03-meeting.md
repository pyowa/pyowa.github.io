#### The Topic

Tom Augspurger, a maintainer of [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/) and [dask](https://github.com/dask/dask), will walk through how to get started in open source. We'll talk about why you might want to contribute to open source and how to find a project to contribute to. Most of the time will be spent walking through the entire process of fixing a small bug in pandas.
