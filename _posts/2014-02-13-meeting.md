Hello Everyone!

You won't want to miss this meeting, we've got an amazing prize to give away. Anyone who attends will be eligible.
We will be raffling off a free pass to [PyCon 2014 in Montreal][pycon].

This month we are going to do a deployment workshop, so bring a laptop. There will be a bunch of virtual
machines available on [Rackspace][rackspace] for everyone to use. We will be walking through the steps to
deploy a [WSGI][wsgi] application to both [Apache][apache] and [Nginx][nginx].

Also, if there is time we can use [capistrano-django][capistrano-django] to automate the deployment of a
[Django][django] application.

As always pizza will be provided by [The IMT Group][imt].
