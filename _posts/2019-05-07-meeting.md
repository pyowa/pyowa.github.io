#### Our Topic

##### Dataclasses
Dataclasses are a new feature added to the Python Standard Library in Python 3.7 through [PEP 557](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/).  Dataclasses are a code generator, creating boiler plate code for you, simplifying the writing of classes, particularly ones that are designed to be mutable data stores.  Weâ€™ll look at writing our own dataclasses and the functionality they provide for us.


#### Our Speaker
Caleb Salt has been using Python for several years now and is fascinated by all the different ways that people use it.  He likes Python and Python People.  He hopes someday to be as awesome as his kids.
