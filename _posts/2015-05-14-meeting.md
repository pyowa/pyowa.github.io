The Raspberry Pi 2 is the new successor to the popular Raspberry Pi computer.  It is a quad-core, single-board computer the size of a credit card with 1 GB RAM, four USB ports, an ethernet port, HDMI port, and more that draws less than 2.5 W of power and costs only $35.

Learn what you can do with this powerful little computer, how to get started using it, what pitfalls to watch out for, and how you can use Python to interface it to other peripheral devices.

There will not be any food or beverages provided this month, but if there is interest we may go out for food and/or drinks after.
