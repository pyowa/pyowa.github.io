#### Our Topic

##### API Driven Development with Django Rest Framework

Django, a high-level Python web framework, with the powerful toolkit Django Rest Framework (DRF) allows for quick and simple API development to provide data for user consumption. APIs can be public facing or used for communication between in-house frontend and backend systems. Regardless the end use, APIs should offer a consistent and flexible experience for the end user.

This presentation offers API motivation while focusing on the code to create an API with DRF. I begin with creating and interacting with the Django/DRF model and serializer classes to build the API. I then look at accessing and consuming the data from a variety of point of views and suggest standardizing data with JSON-API. I hope this presentation will demonstrate one method to build an API: using Django Rest Framework to produce JSON for end user consumption.
