Are you a newbie developer seeking help with a daunting task? Or a seasoned professional looking to stump the room with metaprogramming?  Come one, come all to our Hack Night to socialize and code with others python programmers in this informal event.

There will be no agenda to this event so bring your computer and your python projects and drop in for some coding, some advice, or just some friendly conversation.

IMT will happily provide Pizza and Soda so make sure you BYOP (Bring Your Own Projects!)

Hope to see you there!
