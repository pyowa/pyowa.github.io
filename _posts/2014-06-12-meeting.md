Bring a laptop because this will be a hands-on workshop! We are going to dive into Django templates. We will talk about including templates, template inheritance, blocks, template tags and template filters. The only thing you need is a laptop with Python installed.

Pizza will be provided by IMT. So come hungry (for Pizza and Django knowledge), and bring a friend!

Hope to see you there!
