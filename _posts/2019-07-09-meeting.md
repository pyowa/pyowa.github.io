#### Our Topic

##### Django Workshop
This workshop will bring us from the ground up in building APIs built with Django. Please come with Python 3+ and Django 2+ installed. At the end, we will have REST URL endpoints built for client side consumption. Django, a high-level Python web framework, with the powerful toolkit Django Rest Framework (DRF) allows for the quick and simple API development that we will be doing. We’ll start by building our models, views and serializers. We will investigate these objects in the python shell and check out the Django Admin, which offers great potential as a CMS. If there is time, we will also investigate deploying these API endpoints onto Heroku.
