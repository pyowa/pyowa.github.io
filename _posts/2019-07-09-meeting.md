#### Our Topic

##### Django Workshop
This workshop will bring us from the ground up in building APIs built with Django. Please come with Python 3+ and Django 2+ installed. At the end, we will have REST URL endpoints built for client side consumption. Django, a high-level Python web framework, with the powerful toolkit Django Rest Framework (DRF) allows for the quick and simple API development that we will be doing. Weâ€™ll start by building our models, views and serializers. We will investigate these objects in the python shell and check out the Django Admin, which offers great potential as a CMS. If there is time, we will also investigate deploying these API endpoints onto Heroku.
