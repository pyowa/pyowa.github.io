Hello Everyone! This month I would like to do something different. Let's play a game called [BrainTank][BrainTank].

Everyone who attends will create their own BrainTank brain, or pair up with someone else to create a brain then
we will have all of the tanks battle eachother until only one remains.

If you plan to attend, please try to follow the [BrainTank][BrainTank] installation instructions before showing up.

There will be free food and drink for everyone who attends. So, join us it should be a great time.

Here is a very short preview of what [BrainTank][BrainTank] looks like:
