#### Our Topic

Programming is garnering a lot interest these days.  Schools are starting to allow "coding" to take the place of science and math graduation requirements.  Whether you are trying to interest someone in this fascinating field, teach a new developer, or just help your coworkers, being a mentor can be a tremendously rewarding experience and change someone's life.

#### Our Speakers

Caleb Salt is an aspiring developer trying to learn a little more each day.  He spends his time writing tests and shuffling bits around through APIs.  When not tinkering on the computer you can find his family playing games or out hiking.
