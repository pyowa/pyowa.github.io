#### Our Topic: Lightning Talks

Come present on topics that have recently interested you. Each lightning talk
should be a short presentation (5-15 minutes) on a topic that would be interesting
to most Python programmers.

Sign up to present at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0T0ymJ2XE7VToIje__J6tXKV11Tb9M-ua9XZDF4-lw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0T0ymJ2XE7VToIje__J6tXKV11Tb9M-ua9XZDF4-lw/edit?usp=sharing).

We encorage everyone to prepare something to present, but just attending is perfectly fine too.
