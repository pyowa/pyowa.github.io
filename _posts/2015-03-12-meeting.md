Do you use or are you interested in using Vim for Python development or really for any reason? [Matt][matt] will demonstrate many of the features of Vim that he uses every day for Python development as well as other things that go along with searching, editing, moving and creating files.

If you would like to follow along you will be more than welcome, please try to get [Jarrod Taylor's][jarrod] dotfiles installed in advance from here: [https://github.com/jarrodctaylor/dotfiles][dotfiles].

IMT will happily provide Pizza and Soda.

Hope to see you there!
