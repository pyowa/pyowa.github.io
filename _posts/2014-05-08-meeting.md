Did you miss PyCon 2014? Need a quick overview of what you missed, like this years keynotes, interesting talks, and what to look forward to next year?

This months meeting will be two parts. The first will be an overview of PyCon2014 and why you should attend next year. We will highlight interesting talks and libraries to keep track of.

The second half will be a workshop showing of manipulation of the python AST to do some interesting things. We will install and play with [hylang](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/) which is a lisp that integrates very nicely with Python. Bring your laptop with python 2.7 and pip installed (python 3 should work too, but you are on your own). The basis of this talk comes from a PyCon2014 talk.

The talk and workshop will be given by Spencer Herzberg. Spencer is a software engineering consultant at Source Allies, Inc and is currently working on and Android tablet and phone application that talks with a python backend server for a local manufacturing and service business. He is interested in devops automation with Docker and Python. Check him out at [github.com/sherzberg](http://github.com/sherzberg) or on Twitter [@linuxconvert](http://twitter.com/linuxconvert).
