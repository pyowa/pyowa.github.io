#### Our Topic

##### Working with PDFs in Python

In this talk, you will learn how to work with PDFs using Python. There are many PDF libraries in Python that allow you to interact with and create PDFs in different ways.

You will learn how to do the following tasks:

* Extract metadata from a PDF

All these things and more can be done with Python and a little bit of know how!
