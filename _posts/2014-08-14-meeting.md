This month we are going to be discussing, as a group, an idea that Jim Kraai posed to the group.

We will debug and improve the following code a few times while debating the relative merits of various excludes or ways of biasing hypothetical 'includes':

```python
import time,random
import pizza

excludes = ['onion','mushroom']

noms = pizza.large()

for x in range(2):

    while True:
        topping = random.sample(pizza.stdToppings)
        if topping not in excludes:
            break

    noms.addToppings( topping )

noms.cook()

# be patient, let it set
time.sleep(5*60*1000)

noms.serve()
```
