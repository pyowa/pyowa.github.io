### Our Presenter

__About Caleb Salt__

I am a developer at IMT Computer Services.  I got a degree in Political Science from Iowa State and then spent 6 1/2 years writing code in a proprietary mainframe scripting language.  Two years ago I decided to change my career, picked up an entirely new tech stack, and have been loving it.

__The Topic__

My first programming classes in college were so bad that I withdrew from school and worked for a couple of years before regaining a love for programming.

Since then I've had a number of opportunities to mentor youth wanting to learn programming, teach a class for homeschoolers, give presentations at high schools, and mentor new hires fairly fresh to professional programming.  Two years ago I made a radical shift in my professional career and once again had the opportunity to be reminded of what is is like to go back to the beginning and learn afresh.

Discussion items:

- Inspiring love of programming
- Experiences of what has worked and not
- Tools, learning materials, teaching methods
- Why Python is awesome
- Mentoring others

I'd like to have an open discussion open to anyone's contributions.
Feel free to send me any contributions or ideas before hand.
