#### Our Topic

##### HiringDSM: The Open Source Job Board Project for Des Moines
 - [https://hiringdsm.com](https://hiringdsm.com)
 - [https://github.com/hiringdsm](https://github.com/hiringdsm)


HiringDSM is an open source job board. The frontend is written using Laravel which consumes a RESTful JSON API written in Python using tools such as Flask, Flask-JWT, Flask-Restless, Flask-Admin, etc.. I will be talking about the API primarily, why I picked the tools I did, how I setup the project and how the tools used have helped rapidly produce this project. I hope that this presentation will serve as a decent introduction to using Flask for API's and address concerns/questions with RESTful API development in general. I also hope to build up community support for the project and will discuss the contributing process which will let members of the community see how open source projects can be managed using GitHub and widely accepted/adopted strategies for organization of those projects.
