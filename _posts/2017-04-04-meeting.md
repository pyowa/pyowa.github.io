__The Topic__

Intro to Creating PDFs with Reportlab

Many jobs require you to produce documents programmatically. One of the most popular document formats is Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). The Reportlab package allows Python developers to generate PDFs in a very straight-forward manner. In this talk, Mike will help you learn how to do the following:

Create a simple PDF
Draw text, lines, circles, rectangles
Insert graphics
Learn about formatting your text
Add tables
Create a multi-page document
There might be more depending on how quickly we get through all that. I'm going to write up a simple data generator and parser too so we can play around with document processing.
